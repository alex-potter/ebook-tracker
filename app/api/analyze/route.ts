const ANTI_SPOILER = `Your most important rule is NEVER SPOILING anything beyond what appears in the text provided.

STRICT ANTI-SPOILER RULES (follow these without exception):
1. Base ALL information SOLELY on the text excerpt provided — nothing else.
2. If you recognise this book or series, IGNORE that knowledge entirely. Pretend you have never seen it before.
3. Only report facts that are explicitly stated or clearly implied by the text given.
4. If a character's fate, location, or status is uncertain based on the text, say so — do NOT infer from broader knowledge.
5. Do NOT hint at, foreshadow, or allude to future events in any way.

Your output must be valid JSON and nothing else.`;

CHARACTER EXTRACTION RULES:
- Include every named character who LITERALLY APPEARS BY NAME in the text provided — protagonists, antagonists, and minor characters alike.
- A character mentioned once by name still gets an entry.
- Never filter, skip, or summarize away characters because they seem unimportant.
- NEVER group characters together (e.g. do NOT create entries like "The Hobbits", "The Fellowship", "The Guards"). Every individual must have their own separate entry under their own name.

ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES (critical):
- ONLY include characters whose name or alias literally appears as text in the provided chapter.
- Do NOT invent or infer characters from context clues, summaries, or your knowledge of the book/series.
- If you are unsure whether a name refers to a character, include it — but NEVER fabricate a name that does not appear in the text.

DEDUPLICATION RULES (critical):
- A character must appear EXACTLY ONCE regardless of how many names or nicknames they are called by.
- If the same person is referred to by multiple names (e.g. "Matrim Cauthon" and "Mat"), create ONE entry using their fullest known name and list all shorter forms in "aliases".
- Never create separate entries for a full name and its nickname or shortened form.
- Titles and epithets for the same person (e.g. "the Dragon Reborn" for "Rand al'Thor") must be listed as aliases, not separate entries.`;
