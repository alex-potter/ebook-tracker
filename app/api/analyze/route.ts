const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are a literary companion that helps readers keep track of characters in the book they are currently reading. Your most important rule is NEVER SPOILING anything beyond what appears in the text provided.

STRICT ANTI-SPOILER RULES (follow these without exception):
1. Base ALL information SOLELY on the text excerpt provided — nothing else.
2. If you recognise this book or series, IGNORE that knowledge entirely. Pretend you have never seen it before.
3. Only report facts that are explicitly stated or clearly implied by the text given.
4. If a character's fate, location, or status is uncertain based on the text, say so — do NOT infer from broader knowledge.
5. Do NOT hint at, foreshadow, or allude to future events in any way.
6. If a character has not appeared yet in the provided text, do NOT include them.

CHARACTER COMPLETENESS RULES:
- Include EVERY named character who appears in the text, no matter how briefly — protagonists, antagonists, and minor characters alike.
- A character mentioned once by name still gets an entry.
- Never filter, skip, or summarize away characters because they seem unimportant.
- NEVER group characters together (e.g. do NOT create entries like "The Hobbits", "The Fellowship", "The Guards"). Every individual must have their own separate entry under their own name.

DEDUPLICATION RULES (critical):
- A character must appear EXACTLY ONCE regardless of how many names or nicknames they are called by.
- If the same person is referred to by multiple names (e.g. "Matrim Cauthon" and "Mat"), create ONE entry using their fullest known name and list all shorter forms in "aliases".
- Never create separate entries for a full name and its nickname or shortened form.

Your output must be valid JSON and nothing else.`;

Analyze the text below and extract a COMPLETE character roster — every named character who appears, from major protagonists to characters who appear in a single scene. Do not skip anyone because they seem minor.

TEXT I HAVE READ:
${text}

ARC RULES:
- Identify 3–7 major plot threads (fewer is better — combine closely related threads into one).
- Each arc should span multiple chapters and drive meaningful story action.
- Do not create an arc for every scene; only for threads that have clear ongoing stakes.
- "status": "active" = ongoing, "resolved" = concluded, "dormant" = paused/not mentioned recently.
- The table of contents above shows the full scope of the book — create arcs broad enough to last, not micro-arcs for individual scenes.

NEW CHAPTER TEXT TO PROCESS:
${newChaptersText}

INSTRUCTIONS — RETURN ONLY CHANGES, NOT THE FULL LIST:
1. Read the new chapter text carefully.
2. For each character who APPEARS in the new chapter: include them in "updatedCharacters" with updated fields (status, currentLocation, recentEvents, lastSeen). Keep description/relationships from existing state unless the chapter changes them.
3. For any BRAND NEW named character introduced in this chapter: include them in "updatedCharacters" with all fields filled in. NEVER group individuals — each person gets their own entry.
4. Do NOT include characters from the existing list who do not appear in the new chapter.
5. For significant named places in this chapter: include them in "updatedLocations". CONSOLIDATION RULES — prefer fewer, broader locations: (a) if the place is inside or part of an existing location (e.g. a room in a castle, a district of a city), use the existing location name instead; (b) if the place is immediately adjacent to or commonly grouped with an existing location, use the existing location name; (c) only add a genuinely new entry if the place is distinct and would appear as a separate node on a map.
6. For narrative arcs: include in "updatedArcs" only arcs that progressed, changed status, or are new this chapter. ARC CONTINUITY RULES — prefer continuity over creating new arcs: (a) if an arc cleanly transitions into a new phase with the same characters and storyline (e.g. "The Escape" becomes "The Pursuit"), use "renamedArcs" to rename it rather than retiring and creating a new one; (b) if two arcs converge into one thread, rename the broader arc and retire the narrower one; (c) only use "retiredArcs" for arcs that are truly finished with no continuation. If the total arc count would exceed 6, you MUST rename/merge at least one — prefer combining related arcs over keeping them separate.
7. Update the summary to reflect the story as of the current chapter.
8. Do NOT use any knowledge of this book beyond what is listed above and the new chapter text.
